    With the use of Twint we extracted tweets with words cybersecurity, cybercrime, cyberattacks, cyberpandemic on the ten languages. <br> We have 10 000 tweets for each country from top 10 attacked countries. After analyzing the date we tried to research attentively especially tweets in Russian and in English.
    Collected information will be processed with the use of Python and VoyantTools.
    To create visualizations in Tableau <br> we decided to analyze the top 10 cyber attacked countries.

<h1>So, what data we've collected? <br></h1>

    <tr>
        <td width="450"><img src="../img/6.png" alt="logo" onclick="changeSizeImage(this)"></td>
        <td>English tweets word frequency. As we can see from the line chart in Application 1, the most common words are cybercrime and cyberattacks along with security, which is no surprise. What is interesting, is that words frequency analysis also highlighted such words as ransomware, malware, fraud and business. Based on that, we can make a prediction that English speaking Twitter users concerned not only with the safety of their data but also with the safety of their financial activities. And the second conclusion might be that they are also concerned with the risks within the business field.  </td>

    <tr>
        <td width="450"><img src="../img/10.png" alt="logo" onclick="changeSizeImage(this)"></td>
        <td>English tweets topic modelling. The results of this analysis were not surprising as most topics started with the prefix cyber-. The results were divided into five groups and their interpretation could only be vague. The first and the second ones, presumably, lied within the field of cybersecurity. All of the others include some surprising part, such as “latvian”, “zeroday”, so their interpretation does not seem reasonable at all, as we do not want to speculate on the topic.

        <td>Number of tweets rate per country. The graph is showing that the interest in the research topic gradually grew, only to show skyrocketing results this year. Interesting enough, if we filter and take a look at the tweets number per country, we will see different results. For example, Russia and China show a decrease in interest in the topic in recent years. </td>

    <h3 class="SubHeader">Some statistics</h3>
    <ol class="MethodWrapper">
        <li>Cybercrime costs the global economy about 1 trillion — 50% more than that predicted in 2018. Also, it is more than 1% of the global GDP. </li>
        <li>The average cost of a data breach in 2020 was a whopping  $3.86 million. In 2021 it was $4.24 million.</li>
