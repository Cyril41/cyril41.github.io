    During the coronavirus outbreak, the term “cyber pandemic” was created by WEF  experts as an analogy to the global coronavirus pandemic. Together with the University of Oxford, the Forum developed the program "The Series of the Future: Cybercrime-2025" . Within its framework, a report on the systemic risks of new technologies with recommendations on cybersecurity was published.

    <h3 class="SubHeader">Among the main cyber risks, the authors of the report call:</h3>
    <ol class="MethodWrapper">
        <li>Lack of specialists and technologies — companies do not have time to train or hire personnel who are well versed in the latest technologies and know how to protect data in the new environment.</li>
        <li>Non-systematic approaches — the latest technologies are developing too quickly, and companies do not have time to develop and implement complex strategies, acting chaotically and inconsistently.</li>
        <li>Lack of investment — companies and governments do not consider cybersecurity a priority, preferring to invest in new technologies rather than in ways to protect against digital threats.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>Pandemic influence on the rapid growth of these problems is hard to deny. The COVID-19 pandemic caused many citizens to work from home for the first time. Distance working has other cybersecurity threats, such as intentional cybercrime. When any personal computer or mobile phone is compromised, unauthorized access to the stored information can have a devastating effect on personal, emotional, financial, and working life. The consequences of the cyber-attacks are dangerous not only for individuals but also for large companies and corporations, causing multimillion losses. This is why we decided to analyze social awareness of the problem through one of the most popular social network – Twitter.</p>
