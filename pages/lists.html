    <h7>I graduated from the Faculty of Philology of Moscow State University, so working with texts and data has always surrounded me.
        It is interesting to observe how all processes are automated even in language, so I would like to have a deeper understanding of applied methods in data processing and ways of keeping it.
        I had to work in support of a social network where we were taught how important it is to keep the data safe and avoid social engineering and other threats.</h7>

    <br><h7>For me applied artificial intelligence, analysis means understanding a language, and synthesis means generating a literate text. Solving these problems will mean creating a more convenient form of interaction between a computer and a person.

    I was interested in exploring the intersection points of NLP and gender equality issues. I recently found out that voice assistants differ in gender biases, a Unesco publication made me think about changing the actual language and its reflection in machine learning. </h7>
    <br><br>I studied museology at SPBU and now work at the Erarta Museum. I have always been interested in keeping the personal data of users and visitors and how the user giving his data to social networks can be influenced by the algorithms. It seems to me that soon we will be able to understand the state of mind of the user who left a review with the help of emotional intelligence and machine learning.

    <br>I believe that NLP is a very perspective sphere of DH not only in terms of contemporary culture but also as a part of international science. Although DH is a new field for me, I gain progress every day and find it to be very entertaining for myself as well. Every subject opens new borders of the knowledge which I find very motivating. It will also give me an opportunity to work abroad and meet specialist all over the world.
